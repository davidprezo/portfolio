I love creating things that pull out the observers’ emotions. I hope, with my designs, to make people laugh, confused, sad, happy, and even maybe a bit worried. I love having full control of people's emotions with my work. I am a huge fan of motion graphics first, and aspire to do this for as long as I can. Motion adds a new layer to design that can be utilized in such clever and creative ways, and I want to explore that world to its full potential.
